# iPendel
Inverted pendulums are no longer rare; today, there are numerous variations explored across academic and hobbyist communities. This project focuses on the independent, from-scratch development of a reaction wheel type inverted pendulum.

What sets this project apart is the use of Simscape/SimMechanics for modeling and simulating the controller. Unlike many similar projects that rely on simplified or purely mathematical models, this implementation leverages physical modeling tools to more accurately capture the system dynamics.

The project title is inspired by an article published in Elektor magazine.
